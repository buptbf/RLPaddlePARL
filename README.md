## Reinforcement Learning with PaddlePaddle and PARL ##

[PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle), as the only independent R&D deep learning platform in China, has been officially open-sourced to professional communities since 2016. It is an industrial platform with advanced technologies and rich features that cover core deep learning frameworks, basic model libraries, end-to-end development kits, tools & components as well as service platforms. PaddlePaddle is originated from industrial practices with dedication and commitments to industrialization. It has been widely adopted by a wide range of sectors including manufacturing, agriculture, enterprise service, and so on while serving more than 1.5 million developers. With such advantages, PaddlePaddle has helped an increasing number of partners commercialize AI.

[PARL](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PARL) is a flexible and high-efficient reinforcement learning framework.
